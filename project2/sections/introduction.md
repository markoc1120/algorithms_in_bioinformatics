# Global alignment with different gap costs

## Introduction

The report summarizes the results of global alignment with both linear and affine gap costs with at most quadratic time and space complexity for the calculation of the optimal alignment costs. There is also a figure which depicts the the above, and compares the linear and affine implementations' time complexity. In addition, the answers for the questions (_project2_eval.txt_) can also be found. The implemented algorithms were tested for all the test cases that we were given in _project2_examples.txt_. We think everything works as expected. This report is/was also generated automatically by using snakemake.
